first you need open your fuseki with localhost:3030 , and create FILM datasets then you need to upload film.ttl
then after that you need to upload buku.ttl on the same datasets but you need to rename the graph to buku from default 
then open your phpmyadmin and upload SWMovie and SWLogin to database named SW 
after that you move all of this file into 1 folder and place it into htdocs folder 
then run your .php file on browser like usual 
enjoy :)
